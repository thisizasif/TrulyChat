# TrulyChat · Lightweight Real-Time Chat

**TrulyChat** is a minimalist, real-time, channel-based chat application built for instant communication without friction.  
Join any channel using a simple numeric ID and start chatting immediately—no accounts, no setup, no barriers.

---

## ✨ Overview

TrulyChat is a web-based chat system designed for temporary, spontaneous conversations.  
Instead of usernames, passwords, or invitations, users simply enter the same channel number to connect instantly.  
Messages are synchronized in real time using Firebase, with a clean interface that works across all devices.

**Core Philosophy**: Simple, fast, anonymous, and accessible.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Enter a Channel** – Choose a number between 1–9999.
2. **Connect Instantly** – The app joins that channel via Firebase Realtime Database.
3. **Get a Random Name** – A temporary display name is generated for anonymity.
4. **Chat in Real Time** – Messages are instantly synced to everyone in the channel.
5. **See Who's Online** – Live user counts update as people join or leave.
6. **Leave Anytime** – Closing the tab removes your presence automatically.
